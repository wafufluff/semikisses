<h2>Lyrics</h2>

<pre>
Roughed up lover
With a stone cold cover
Is there room for another?
Cause I (cause I)

I'm a real tough lady
I can renovate
Chip away til' I
Make it inside (inside)

I wanna be more than just close to you (ahh)
More than laying just next to you

I wanna rip you open
Shed some light on
What you're hoping to keep (ooh)
From me (ooh)

I fill your every breath
And watch your chest
Rise as you're falling asleep (ooh)
Asleep (ooh)

I would find a little spot where I can live by your spleen
Be a filter for your body
Happy keeping you clean
I wanna rip you open
I'm your doctor
Your prescription is me, is me, is me

If it's too much baby
You can lay it on me
Put away your
Hardened disguise

Let me be your Rocco
We could take turns swapping
Share the weight
You've been holding too tight

I wanna be more than just close to you (ahh)
More than laying just next to you

I wanna rip you open
Shed some light on
What you're hoping to keep (ooh)
From me (ooh)

I fill your every breath and watch your chest
Rise as you're falling asleep (ooh)
Asleep (ooh)

I would find a little spot where I can live by your spleen
Be a filter for your body
Happy keeping you clean
I wanna rip you open
I'm your doctor
Your prescription is me (ooh), is me (ooh), is me
